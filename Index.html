    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate
        technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the
        structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's
        behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business
        context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify
        stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible webbased applications.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Unit Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These
        inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
        and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the
        Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process
        referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
        understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
        designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of
        the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities
        through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.

    <ul>
        <li>Receive an overall grade of 5 or above (a mark 50% or greater of the overall marks possible); and</li>
        <li>Submit all assessments.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>Assessment Moderation</h2>
    <h3>Fair assessment through moderation</h3>
    <p>
        Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning
        outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for the moderation
        of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available from
        <a href="https://policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/" target="_blank">https://policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Pre-marking moderation</h2>
    <p>
        A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and monitor and
        confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking
        criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to
        ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.
    </p>

    <h2>Intra-marking / Post-marking moderation</h2>
    <p>The following intra-marking / post-marking moderation practices are planned for use in this unit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries</li>
        <li>Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions wherestudents have not met the pass requirements</li>
        <li>Analysis of the variances between markers and locations</li>
        <li>Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and standards </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Late assessment</h2>
    <p>
        Where the submission of a late assessment is permitted, late penalties will be consistently applied in this unit.
        Where a late assessment is permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the Assessment
        Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:
        1. For assessment items submitted within the first 24 hours after the due date/time, students will be penalised
        by a deduction of 5% of the total marks allocated for the assessment task;
        2. For each additional 24 hour period commenced an additional penalty of 10% of the total marks allocated
        for the assessment item will be deducted; and
        3. Assessment items submitted more than 168 hours late (7 calendar days) will receive a mark of zero.
        Where late assessment <span class="bolded">is</span> NOT permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the
        Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:
        1. All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will receive a mark of zero.
